# instacart-analytics-project
Data analysis project for Instacart exploring customer profiles and purchasing behavior. Includes sales pattern insights by time, product popularity, loyalty segmentation, and demographic impacts. Uses Python (pandas, seaborn) for data cleaning, visualization, and actionable marketing recommendations.
## Project Overview
This project involves a detailed exploratory data analysis of Instacartâ€™s grocery shopping dataset, combined with a synthetic customer dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into customer purchasing behaviors, sales patterns, and customer segmentation to inform targeted marketing strategies.

The analysis aims to answer key business questions such as identifying peak order times, product popularity by category and price range, and customer loyalty patterns. Additionally, demographic factors like age, income, and family status are examined to better profile customers and tailor marketing campaigns effectively.

## Data Description
Instacart Grocery Dataset (2017): Contains order histories including order timestamps, product information, prices, and department categorizations.

Customer Dataset: Synthetic data created to enrich the Instacart dataset with demographic details such as age, gender, income, family status, and loyalty indicators.

Both datasets are merged to enable comprehensive analysis of customer behavior and sales trends.

## Data Source
The Instacart dataset is publicly available via Kaggle: Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017

Customer dataset created specifically for this project.
